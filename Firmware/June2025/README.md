ESP32-S3  (Flash=8MB)

For Video 43, we are using the Waveshare ESP32-S3-LCD-4.3 display.

There is a special build we did on 13 June 2025 to create a firmware for this device.
Please look at the Firmware folder for: lvgl_micropy_ESP32_GENERIC_S3-SPIRAM_OCT-8.bin

Also please download the three driver files in the Flash

Now the test_matrix2_lcdbus.py program will work.

For the test_button2_lcdbus.py, you will need to load a microSD card with the font folder files
contained in the sdcard folder.
