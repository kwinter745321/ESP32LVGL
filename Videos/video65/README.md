# Scope
This is video 65 on embedded solutions. In this video, we discuss the E32R28T device.  The device is similar to the Cheap Yellow Display ("CYD"), as it has an ILI9341 display and xpt2046 touchscreen. However, it is configured differently.  We discuss the E32R28T device and its components.  We discuss in extra detail the firmware deployment as well as the display and touch configuration.  We run several demonstration programs that are colorful and also help us verify the touchscreen functionality.

You can fetch the programs from the Github, and begin using them immediately.  As this The video explains how the various display and touch functions interact with LVGL, a new person or someone seeking more behind the scenes knowledge will get keen insight.
