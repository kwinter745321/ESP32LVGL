We pulled Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and installed docker.
Ubuntu usually includes python.

Additionally, we performed these pre-requisites

sudo apt update
sudo apt install xxxx

where xxx is the following:
build-essential 
cmake 
ninja-build 
git
libusb-1.0-0-dev
gcc-arm-none-eabi
net-tools
nano
mc
python3-venv

Then we pulled the LVGL/MicroPython source:
git clone https://github.com/lvgl_micropython.git

We then cd into the lvgl_micropython directory and performed the following:
python3 make.py esp32 BOARD=ESP32_GENERIC_S3 BOARD_VARIANT=SPIRAM_OCT DISPLAY=ili9341 INDEV=gt911 INDEV=xpt2046

Now, cd into the build directory ("build" was created by the above python program)
Here resides two files:
lvgl_micropy_ESP32_GENERIC_S3-SPIRAM_OCT-8.bin
partitions.csv

Finally you can use a sftp command to push the bin to your desktop.
