# README.md - Video71

11 January 2026

# Scope
This is video 71 on an Arduino LVGL embedded solution. In this video, we add a DSI display to the ESP32-P4 board in a previous video.  We utilize Arduino and the Waveshare demo software to setup a LVGL environment.  Then, we use our test_slider program to help orient the screen in Landscape mode.  

You can fetch the firmware and programs from the GitHub, and begin using them immediately.  

In this video, 
    • Present the DSI Display and show cable connections.
    • Demonstrate the Waveshare demo software.
    • Present the test_slider program to show how we setup Landscape mode.
    • Walk through the program code and demonstrate the screen.

The code for this video is available at the GitHub site:
